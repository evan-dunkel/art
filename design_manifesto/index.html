            <div id="paragraph">
                <div>The student to company pipeline is ruining the world. While the world burns, new graduates paste a few green words on packaging. While the world burns millions are forced to work towards the collapse of humankind. While the world burns we are coerced by the loaded gun of poverty to betray our comrades. One misstep and you fall off the ladder, then you notice it’s made of bodies like yours. They were too stupid, maybe even unlucky. No utopian white collar jobs for them.</div>
                <div>Maybe we should design a product to fix this. Let’s fix everything with new products. How about we fix poverty at an organization that’s dependent on cancerous concentrations of capital.</div>
                <div>It’s important to acknowledge that not every appendage of global market society behaves as punitively, as horrendously, as sub-humanly as the United States. Not every tentacle of the global economy exports war and hatred and suffering at the same scale. But most rely on it to survive. These are choices.</div>
                <div>I must admit, I have never stepped foot into a Northrop Grumman office. Nor a design firm. Not a large NGO. But I fail to see how design will save the world in a proposed imaginary vacuum. It seems ignorant, at best, for the design industry to profess ethics and sustainability while the field is subservient to the crushing force of exploitation. There are so many subsets of exploitation but they lead back to a malignant system that has metastasized across the world.</div>
                <div>But hey, at least Foxconn has suicide nets.</div>
                <div>When the pipeline of design students to companies exists, how can we ever consider biting the economic hand that feeds us? How can we do what we must to make the world tolerable? For educators who have the means, they must honor their sacred platform to self-reflect on what it means to exist within a deeply inequitable world. Instruction must take into account how we can materially apply our abilities to urgent change. While indeed, many designers by profession can be extraordinarily privileged, privilege must not be an excuse for ignorance. Being able bodied, emotionally secure, and having access, to list a few: these resources can and must be leveraged on behalf of those who cannot fight for desperately needed change.</div>
                <div>It’s not enough to tack ethics and sustainability onto the process, before or after profit. Much like how design is rightfully being promoted from “nice to have” to “essential,” we must grow beyond design as a means to exploit profits. We must design to usurp power, design to construct democratic decolonized systems, design to materially improve the lives of the vulnerable: design to imagine what could be.</div>
                <div>I wish for every creator to become a change agent. While I do not yet know precisely how we reach that future, I know this necessary work to be joyous and imaginative but also vulnerable and sometimes painful. We must put our money where our copywriting is: it’s time to re-sculpt sustainability in design from performative to transformative.</div>
